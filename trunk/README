PLUTO
=======================

Pluto is licensed under the Apache 2 License and contains
other opens source libraries.  Each dependency license is
included within this distribution.

Pluto is organized into multiple subprojects:
1) container: the core portlet container implementation.

2) portal: a thin portal wrapper which can be used for 
   testing the container and/or portlets.

3) testsuite: a test portlet which can be used to test 
   the portlet container implementaion.

This release of the Pluto Driver contains an
administrative interface that can be used to deploy custom portlets to
Pluto's portal. It can be accessed using the Admin link on the navigation
bar. When the Admin Portlet Application has been rendered, click on the
Help mode in the Deploy War portlet to access information on deploying
custom portlets. The Deploy War Portlet needs a portlet bundled in a war
file as defined by the JSR-168 specification. It will do the work of
modifying web.xml and the portlet registry files (porletentityregistry.xml,
pageregistry.xml and portletcontexts.txt) to deploy the custom portlet.
However, when the deployment alters web.xml, there may be some problems
with carrying over all the original elements (see PLUTO_92 in the Jira bug
system). This should be fixed in the next release of Pluto.

Please see GETTING-STARTED.html for additional assistance.


  Thanks for using Pluto.
