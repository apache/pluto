Follow the steps below to compile and install Pluto
<p><strong>Prepare Environment</strong>
   <ul>
	<li>Download and Install a Java Development Kit release (version 1.3.1) 
        from http://java.sun.com/j2se/</li>
    <li>Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the 
			release.</li>
    <li>Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
		to which the JDK has been installed.</li>
    <li>Download and Install the Tomcat 4.1 Binary Distribution from 
		http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.1</li>
    <li>Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the 
        distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named 
		"jakarta-tomcat-4.1"). For the purposes of the remainder of this 
		document, the symbolic name "${catalina.home}" is used to refer to the 
		full pathname of the release directory.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Install Pluto</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>Download Pluto the latest source from 
        <a href="/site/sourceindex.cgi">the Jakarta Source index</a>
		or directly from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html">
        cvs</a>. Place the source tree in a directory which will be
        referred to for the remainder of this document as ${pluto.home}.</li>
    <li>From the command line, go to the ${pluto.hom}/build directory and call 
			"build", if you need to completely rebuild you can use "build rebuild"</li>
    <li>Call the "install" script (install.bat or install.sh). You will be asked 
			to type the Path where Tomcat is installed</li>
    <li>Start Up Tomcat 4.1. Please see Tomcat instructions for information
    <li>Run Pluto: Default url to start Pluto is </li>
			http://localhost:8080/pluto/portal</li>
	<li>In case Tomcat runs on a different port, change the port setting in 
        ${catalina.home}/webapps/pluto/WEB-INF/config/services/ConfigService.properties</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Install Portlets</strong>
   <p>
    <ul>To install portlets after you successfully installed Pluto, copy the 
        portlet war's to the ${pluto.home}/portlets directory and execute 
		<code>${pluto.home}/build/build.bat deploy_portlets</code>
