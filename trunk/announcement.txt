  Release Announcement Template
-->

  The Apache Pluto Community is proud to announce the release
  of Apache Pluto 1.0.1-rc-1: the first binary release of the
  reference implementation of the Java Portlet Specification.

  Pluto 1.0.1-rc-1 is considered a release candidate.  The
  promotion of this release candidate to general availability
  is expected within the few weeks, pending feedback from 
  the community.

  The Java Portlet Specification defines a Portlet API
  very similar to the Servlet API. The API provides a means
  for aggregating disperate content sources.  The specification
  addresses security and personalization considerations and 
  defines a standard with which these sources, or portlets 
  can be deployed.

  Pluto is an embedable portlet container which will typically
  be bundled within a fully functional Portal.  The Pluto 
  community has developed a simple portal driver implementation
  which allows for the testing and development of portlets with
  the container.  The Pluto testsuite is an implementation 
  agnostic portlet application which tests several basic
  operations of the container in which it is deployed.

  The distribution is organized into four releases:

  1) A binary distribution bundled with Tomcat. This
     distribution is the easiest to install.
  
  2) A source distribution.
  
  3) A binary distribution containing the container library.
  
  4) A binary tools distribution with the portal driver and 
     testsuite.

  Thanks for using Pluto.
