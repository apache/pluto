/**
 * Manages the life-time of services registered during servlet startup.
 * A service has to derive from {@link org.apache.pluto.services.ContainerService} and implement the
 * <CODE>init()</CODE> and <CODE>destroy()</CODE> methods as appropriate.
 * 
 * <P>
 * By registering the service and its implementation in the file
 * <CODE>/config/services.properties</CODE>, the service will become
 * available to the portal engine. The format of the file is simple:
 * 
 * <PRE>
 *   org.apache.pluto.portalImpl.services.log.Logger = org.apache.pluto.portalImpl.services.log.LogServicesImpl
 * </PRE>
 * 
 * Each entry represents one service. The left-hand side is the abstract
 * service class, the right-hand side is the implementation of this service.
 * The services are initialized in the order of appearance.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Each service can have its own configuration file, located in
 * <CODE>/config/services</CODE>. It has to have the name of either
 * implementation or abstract class of the service, without the
 * leading package name. For example, the service manager looks
 * for <CODE>LoggerImpl
.properties</CODE>. This allows a special
 * implementation to provide different configuration than the
 * general (abstract) service requires.
 * 
 * <P>
 * If present, one of the services configuration files is loaded
 * and passed to the service as {@link org.apache.pluto.portalImpl.util.Properties}
 * object. Not providing a service configuration file is okay too,
 * in that case the properties are empty.
 * 
 * @see org.apache.pluto.services.ContainerService
