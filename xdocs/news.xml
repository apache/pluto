    <subsection name="11 July 2005 - Portals Pluto 1.0.1-rc3 Released">
     <p>
      The Apache Pluto Community is proud to announce the release
      of Apache Pluto 1.0.1-rc-2: the third binary release of the
      reference implementation of the Java Portlet Specification.
     </p>
	 <p>
      The third release candidate contains several bug fixes and 
	  will be followed by a general availability of Pluto 1.0.1.
	  In addition to bug fixes, the release contains a new administrative
	  portlet which can be used to deploy portlets.

    <subsection name="22 December 2004 - Portals Pluto 1.0.1-rc2 Released">
     <p>
      The Apache Pluto Community is proud to announce the release
      of Apache Pluto 1.0.1-rc-2: the second binary release of the
      reference implementation of the Java Portlet Specification.
     </p>
     <p>
      Community feedback will decide if a further release candidate
      is required before a final release.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Java Portlet Specification defines a Portlet API
      very similar to the Servlet API. The API provides a means
      for aggregating disperate content sources.  The specification
      addresses security and personalization considerations and
      defines a standard with which these sources, or portlets
      can be deployed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pluto is an embedable portlet container which will typically
      be bundled within a fully functional Portal.  The Pluto
      community has developed a simple portal driver implementation
      which allows for the testing and development of portlets with
      the container.  The Pluto testsuite is an implementation
      agnostic portlet application which tests several basic
      operations of the container in which it is deployed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The distribution is organized into four releases:
      <ul>
       <li>
        1. A binary distribution bundled with Tomcat. This distribution is the easiest to install.
       </li>
       <li>
        2. A source distribution.
       </li>
       <li>
        3. A binary distribution containing the container library.
       </li>
       <li>
        4. A binary tools distribution with the portal driver and
           testsuite.
       </li>
      </ul>
