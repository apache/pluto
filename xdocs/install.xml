<section name="Installation Guide">
<P>This install guide covers the following types of installations:
<ul><li><A href="#Installing_Distributions">Installing Distributions</A></li>
    <li><A href="#Installing_Portlets">Installing Portlets</A></li></ul>
</P>
</section>

<section name="Installing Distributions">

<subsection name="Binary Distribution">
<P>The binary distribution of Pluto is packaged with Tomcat
   (currently version 5.0.28).  Pluto leverages Tomcat to 
   provide the web container in which the Pluto portlet 
   container executes. The binary distribution includes 
   the Pluto Portlet Container, The Portal Driver, and 
   Pluto Testsuite.</P>
<P>To install the binary distribution:
   <ul>
   <li><A href="mirrors.cgi">Download</A>
       the current binary distribution of Pluto</li>
   <li>Extract the binary distribution to a directory
       from here forward refered to as "&lt;PLUTO_HOME&gt;".</li>
   <li>Startup the server by using the appropriate tomcat 
       startup script located at &lt;PLUTO_HOME&gt;/bin.
       For *nix use startup.sh; for windows use startup.bat.</li>
   <li>Point your browser to 
       <A href="http://localhost:8080/pluto/portal">The Pluto Driver</A>
       and your ready to go!</li>
   </ul>
</P>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Library Distributions">
<P>The pluto library distributions are packaged to allow
   integration with an external portal server.</P>
<P>To install the library distributions to your portal server:
   <ul>Ensure that the pluto-x.x.x.jar is loaded by a classloader
       to which both the portal and portlet application web apps
       have access.</ul></P>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Source Distribution">
<P>Installing the source distribution requires the most effort,
   and is recomended only for those individuals who are interested
   in modifying the container.  The source distribution is 
   basically a snapshot of the source code repository at a given
   time. Because of this, please see the build instructions, which
   will provide information about how to build Pluto from scratch.
   </P>
<P>To install the source distribution into tomcat:
   <ul>
   <li>Install Java 1.3 or greater</li>
   <li>Install Maven 1.0 or greater</li>
   <li>Install Tomcat 4.x or Tomcat 5.x to 
       a directory from here forward refered to as
       &lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;</li>
   <li>Edit your &lt;PLUTO_HOME&gt;/build.properties to include
       the following properties:
       <table><tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th><th>Example(s)</th></tr>
              <tr><td>maven.tomcat.home</td>
                  <td>Tomcat Installation Directory</td>
                  <td><code>\\usr\\local\\jakarta-tomcat.5.0.27</code>, 
                      <code>c:\\jakarta-tomcat.5.0.27</code></td></tr>
              <tr><td>maven.tomcat.version.major</td>
                  <td>Tomcat Major Version Number</td>
                  <td>5</td></tr>
       </table></li>
    <li>From &lt;PLUTO_HOME&gt; issue the command: 
        <code>'maven fullDeployment'</code></li>
    <li>Startup the server by using the appropriate tomcat 
       startup script located at &lt;PLUTO_HOME&gt;/bin.
       For *nix use startup.sh; for windows use startup.bat.</li>
    <li>Point your browser to 
       <A href="http://localhost:8080/pluto/portal">The Pluto Driver</A>
       and your ready to go!</li>

<section name="Installing Portlets">
<P><FONT color="red">
  Currently, to automate the deployment/installation of portlets
  you must utilize the source distribution of pluto.</FONT></P>
<P>To install portlets after you successfully installed Pluto, 
       invoke Maven to deploy the portlet's war by executing:
	<code>maven deploy -Ddeploy=FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PORTLET_WAR</code>
