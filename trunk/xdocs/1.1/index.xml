<p>
Pluto 1.1 is a re-architecture of the version 1.0.1 portlet container to 
make it	easier to embed Pluto in a Portal. The
Pluto Portal Driver has also been refactored in 1.1 to improve ease of use
and modification.
</p>

<subsection name="Building Pluto 1.1">
<p>
Building Pluto 1.1 requires the use of <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven2/index.html">
Maven 2</a> on the Pluto 1.1 branch of the Subversion source code repository. 
</p>
<p>
For instructions on how to obtain the source code for the 1.1 branch see the 
<a href="../developer/subversion.html#Using_Subversion">Using Subversion</a>
section of the Developer Guide, but use
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/portals/pluto/branches/pluto-1.1 as the URI
in the svn commands.
</p>
<p>
See the README document in the source distribution for instructions
on how to build Pluto 1.1, install the portal driver in Tomcat and deploy custom
portlets to the portal.
</p>
