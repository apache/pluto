  To install Pluto 1.1.x from the binary distribution
  package, follow these instructions:
  <ul><li><p>
       Unpack the distribution into a directory from here
       forward referred to as &lt;PLUTO_HOME&gt;
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
       Execute the appropriate startup script located

       this will be startup.sh.  For windows platforms, 
       this will be startup.bat.

<subsection name="Installing From Source">
<p>
  To install Pluto 1.1.x from source, complete the
  following instructions.
  <ul><li><p>
       Set the property name '<code>pluto.testsuite.dir</code>' 
       to the directory in which the pluto testsuite source code
       exists.</p>
      <p><div style="color:red">NOTE:</div>
       The testsuite is 
       not currently included the 1.1 branch as no changes 
       are necessary beyond deployment with the Pluto 1.1.x
       deployer.
      </p></li>

      <li><p>
       Set the property named '<code>tomcat.dir</code>' to the 
       directory which is your <code>TOMCAT_HOME</code> (or 
       <code>TOMCAT_BASE</code>) directory.  This directory 
       will be used when determining where to deploy the portal.
       (The property '<code>maven.tomcat.dir'</code> is now 
       deprecated, but will still work for backwards compatibility).
      </p></li>

      <li><p>
       Run the '<code>pluto:deploy-all</code>' maven goal. This 
       will install the Plutp Portal Driver (and container), 
       and deploy the Testsuite application to the Portal.
      </p></li>

      <li><p>
       The Portal is now deployed.  Startup the Portal by 
       starting up the tomcat installation to which you
       deployed the portal. Once started, you can point 
       your browser to http://localhost:8080/pluto/portal
       to access the portal.
      </p></li>
      </ul>
