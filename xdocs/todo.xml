    <title>ToDo Items for Pluto 1.1</title>
  </properties>

<body>
<section name="ToDo List">
<P>
    Interested in getting involved with the development of
    Pluto 1.1 and don't know where to start?  Having a hard
    time jumping in with two feet because you're not sure
    what to do? Here are a couple of items that need to 
    be worked on.  These are just ideas.  You are encouraged
    to add things to this list, work on other items, or
    scratch whatever itch you have.

    <table>
    <tr><th>ToDo Item</th>
        <th>Compontent</th>
        <th>Actively Being Worked?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Implement the Driver's PortletPreferenceProvider 
            implementation. See: org.apache.pluto.driver.services.PortletPreferencesProviderImpl</td>
        <td>Portal Driver</td>
        <td> No </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Implement a Deployer for Pluto 1.1.  In order to 
            simplify configuration, Pluto 1.1 has changed the
            configuration requirements of portlets being deployed
            to the container.  As a result, a new deployer should
            be written.</td>
        <td>Deployer</td>
        <td> No </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Clean up error/exception messages.  The StringManager
            should be used to create error messages for exceptions
            thrown by the container.  This will allow messages to
            by read from properties files and internationalized.</td>
        <td>Container</td>
        <td> Yes </td></tr>
    </table>
