        Pluto 1.1 utilizes Maven 2 as it's project management and build
        automation tool.  Pluto follows maven's best practices and is organized
        into modules or subprojects.

              project. All other modules either support the development. The
              Pluto Container is the reference implementation of the Portlet
              Specification.

            <li>
              <b>Pluto Tags:</b>

              <b>Pluto Portal Driver:</b>
              A driver library for the Pluto Portlet Container. Provides service
              implementations and utilities for implementing a portal which
              utilizes the container.
            </li>

              Portal. The pluto portal is a simple portal application which
              embeds the portal. The portal is not meant to be a full enterprise
              portal, but instead is meant to be an example of how to embed the
              container and a lightweight environment for developing and testing
              portlets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pluto Testsuite:</b>
