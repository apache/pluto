<h2>Deploy War Portlet Help</h2>


<p class="portlet-font">
This portlet is used to deploy new portlet applications to Pluto packaged
in a war file. Deployment involves unzippling the war file into
Pluto's webapps directory and adding records to the
registry files located in <CATALINA_HOME>/webapps/pluto/WEB-INF/data (
portletentityregistry.xml, pageregistry.xml and portletcontexts.txt).
</p>


<h3>Deploying portlets</h3>

<ol>
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">
Build a valid war file containing the portlet application to be deployed including a portlet.xml and web.xml
file in the WEB-INF directory. DO NOT modify web.xml to include a reference to the PortletServlet. The
deployer will add servlet and servlet-mapping elements related to PortletServlet.
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">Select the war file using the Browse button in the Deploy War
portlet.
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">Click submit. The war will be deployed to Pluto's webapps directory and
a record added to portletentityregistry.xml and portletcontexts.txt in webapp/pluto/WEB-INF/data.
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">Fill in the portlet's title, which will be used as a navigation link in the portal,
and the number of rows and columns needed to display all portlets in the
application. If the portlet app only contains one portlet, then keep the default
one row, one column. The description field on that page is optional.
JavaScript validation is done on this page to make sure that the layout
(rows and columns) can accomodate the number of portlets in the portlet
application that is being deployed.
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">Click submit. The Define Page Layout page should be displayed next.
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">In each row/column cell, select the portlet that will be displayed there.
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">Click Submit. The pageregistry.xml file should be updated and the first
page of the Deploy War portlet displayed. You will also notice new records in the Portlet Entity Registry and Page Registry portlets.
</li>
<li class="portlet-font">Click on the "Hot deploy 'myportlet' portlet application" link to hot deploy the portlet. 
The new portlet and navigation link will then appear.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Redeploying portlets</h3>
<p class="portlet-font">
Redeployment of previously deployed portlets can be done, but the results can be
somewhat flaky due to caching of portlet content by the Pluto portal.
To redeploy select the war file with its new contents using the Browse
button and click Submit.
The new war file will be uploaded, but no changes will be made to the
porletentityregistry.xml or portletcontexts.txt. You should skip the following
two pages that set page layout because they cannot be changed at this time.
</p>
<p class="portlet-font">
Click the 'Deploy War home' link to return to the Deploy War start page. On that page click on the 'Hot deploy . . .' 
link on the bottom of the portlet to be redirected to the redeployed portlet application. 
If the portlet is not refreshed, try clearing your browser cache and/or restarting Pluto. Pluto's
portal, which uses Tomcat, also contains a cache of the portlet contents
within its 'work' directory. This can be deleted after the portal is shutdown
to clear the old content.
</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p class="portlet-font">
The main problem with deployments using the Deploy War Portlet has to do with an improperly formatted portlet.xml file. 
The deployment process validates portlet.xml against the official XML schema. This schema validation
checks portlet.xml for the required XML elements and the order of those elements specified by the schema.
See PLT.21.5 in the JSR-168 specification for details on the XML schema for portlet.xml.
</p>
<p class="portlet-font">
In order for the XML Schema validation to occur correctly, the portlet.xml file must have a root element
(web-app) with all the proper attributes. The following is an example of a correct web-app element:<br/>
&lt;portlet-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_1_0.xsd" version="1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_1_0.xsd http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_1_0.xsd"/&gt;
</p>
