PLUTO 1.1
=======================

Pluto is licensed under the Apache 2 License and contains
other opens source libraries.  Each dependency license is
included within this distribution.

Installation of Pluto 1.1 can be completed by completing
the following steps:

1) Set the property name 'pluto.testsuite.dir' to
   the directory in which the pluto testsuite source
   code exists.  The testsuite is not currently included
   the 1.1 branch as no changes are necessary. (NOTE, 
   the web.xml does container minor changes and thus
   is duplicated in this code base.  The deployment
   targets will handle updating the webapp appropriately).

2) Set the property named 'maven.tomcat.dir' to the
   directory which is your TOMCAT_HOME (or TOMCAT_BASE)
   directory.  This directory will be used when determining
   where to deploy the portal.

3) Set the property named 'maven.tomcat.version.major' to
   the major version of tomcat which you have.

4) Run the 'pluto:deploy-all' maven goal.

5) Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/pluto/portal

6) That's IT!
