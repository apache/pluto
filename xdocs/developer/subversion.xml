  <section name="Developer Guide: Obtaining the Source Code">
  <p>
    There are several reasons why you may want to have access to
    the pluto source code.  Some may want to participate in 
    the development of Pluto by submiting patches.  Others may want
    to utilize Pluto as a reference implementation to clarify
    the Portlet Specification.  Whatever the reason, there are two
    ways to access the source code.
  </p>

  <p>
    <A href="#Downloading_the_Source_Distribution">Downloading the
    most recent Source Distribution</A> is the easiest
    way to access the source.  Of course, because this method is 
    reliant on realeases, you may not have the most recent source.
    That said, you do have a better chance at recieving a more
    stable codebase if you are using a distiribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    <A href="#Using_Subversion">Using Subversion</A> to checkout the
    absolute up-to-date version of the code is the best way to
    retrieve the source code.  If you plan to submit patches, 
    we ask that you use the Subversion Trunk to create your
    diffs.
