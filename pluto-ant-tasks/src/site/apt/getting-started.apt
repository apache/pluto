Getting Started

  The Pluto Ant Tasks have been created to assist those not using
  maven with the assembly, deployment, and publishing of Maven.
  A usage example is shown below:

---------------

  <path id="classes">
    <!--
      Pluto Ant Tasks depend upon the following libraries:
        * pluto-ant-tasks-${version}.jar
        * pluto-util-${version}.jar
        * pluto-descriptor-api-${version}.jar
        * pluto-descriptor-util-${version}.jar
        * commons-logging-1.0.4.jar
        * castor-0.9.6
      -->
    <fileset dir="/path/to/pluto-libraries" includes="**/*.jar"/>
    <fileset dir="/path/to/commons-logging" includes="**/*.jar"/>
    <fileset dir="/path/to/castor" includes="**/*.jar"/>
  </path>

  <typedef name="passemble" classname="org.apache.pluto.ant.AssembleTask"
		  classpathref="classes"/>

   <target name="passemble">
     <passemble 
       webxml="src/config/web.xml" 
       portletxml="src/config/portlet.xml" 
       destfile="src/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml"/>
   </target>
