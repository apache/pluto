       * Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory  into which you installed the JDK release.
       
(1) Download and Install the Tomcat 4.1 Binary Distribution
    * Download a binary distribution of Tomcat from:    
        http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.1/
    * Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the  
      distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named  "jakarta-tomcat-4.1").  
      For the purposes of the remainder of this document,  the symbolic name "${catalina.home}" 
      is used to refer to the full  pathname of the release directory.
