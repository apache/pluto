Getting Started

* Installing Pluto with Maven

  Maven2 is utilized as the project management and build system
  for Pluto 1.1.  The pluto-util subproject can be used to 
  install pluto into the Tomcat servlet engine (Jetty and other
  containers coming soon).

---------------
$> cd <PLUTO-1.1-HOME>
$> mvn install
$> cd ../pluto-util
$> mvn pluto:install -DinstallDir=path/to/appserver
---------------

  The mvn install goal is a built in Maven2 lifecycle which
  builds the project artifacts and installs them into the
  Maven repository.
  
  The pluto:install goal will take the resulting artifacts
  and properly deploy them within the configured tomcat
  installation.

* Manually Installing Pluto

    Step 1: 

---------------
$> cd <PLUTO-1.1-HOME>
$> mvn install
---------------

  Step 2: Copy the following to <TOMCAT_HOME>/shared/lib

    * castor-0.9.6

    * portlet-api-1.0.jar

    * pluto-container-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

    * pluto-descriptor-api-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

    * pluto-descriptor-impl-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

  Step 3: Copy the following to <TOMCAT_HOME>/common/endorsed

    * xercesImpl-2.6.2

    * xmlParserAPIs-2.6.2

  Step 4: Copy the following to <TOMCAT_HOME>/conf/Catalina/localhost

    * <PLUTO_HOME>/pluto-portal/src/main/resources/pluto.xml

    * <PLUTO_HOME>/pluto-testsuite/src/main/resources/testsuite.xml

  Step 5: 

    * pluto-portal.war

    * pluto-testsuite.war

* Installing Pluto with a Windows EXE

  The NSIS Installer is not yet complete, but we hope to have a fully
  functional one soon.  Anyone is more than welcome to assist us in this
  process.

Portlet Assembly and Deployment

* Portlet Assembly

  All portlet applications must be run through
  the pluto assembler before being deployed. The
  assembly process injects pluto specific information
  for deployment.  Specifically, a servlet and servlet
  mapping are added to the deployment descriptor.  This
  servlet will be used to dispatch portlet requests to
  the portlet application. 

  Portlet assembly is accomplished through the 
  pluto-util subproject.


---------------
$> cd pluto-util
$> maven pluto:assemble -Dmaven.deploy.deployment=<path to war>
---------------

* Portlet Deployment:

---------------
$> cd pluto-install
$> maven pluto:deploy -Dmaven.deploy.deployment=<path to war>
---------------
