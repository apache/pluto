/**
 * The <CODE>Portlet</CODE> interface is used by the portlet container to
 * invoke the portlets. Every portlet has to implement this interface,
 * either by directly implementing it, or by using an existing class 
 * implementing the Portlet interface.
 * <P>
 * A portlet is a Java technology-based web component. It is managed by the portlet container and
 * processes requests and generates dynamic content as response. Portlets are used by portals as
 * pluggable user interface components.
 * <p>
 * The content generated by a portlet is called a fragment. A fragment is a piece of
 * markup (e.g. HTML, XHTML, WML) adhering to certain rules and can be aggregated
 * with other fragments into a complete document. The content of a portlet is normally
 * aggregated with the content of other portlets into the portal page. 
 * <P>
 * The portlet container instanciates portlets, manages their lifecycle 
 * and invoking them to process requests. The lifecycle consists of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>initializing the portlet using using the <code>init</code> method
 * <li>request processsing
 * <li>taking the portlet out of service using the <code>destroy</code> method
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Request processing is divided into two types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>action requests handled through the <code>processAction</code> method, 
 *     to perform actions targeted to the portlet
 * <li>render requests handled through the <code>render</code> method, 
 *     to perform the render operation
 * </ul>

   * <p>The portlet container cannot place the portlet into service

   * originated by a URL created (by the portlet) with the 
   * <code>RenderResponse.createActionURL()</code> method.
   * <p>
   * Typically, in response to an action request, a portlet updates state 
   * based on the information sent in the action request parameters.
   * In an action the portlet may:
   * <ul>
   * <li>issue a redirect

   * action request and many render requests, one per portlet in the portal page.
