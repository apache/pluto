Pluto Descriptor Service Implementation

    The Pluto descriptor services provide an entry point for reading and 
writing object models representing the portlet descriptor files
(<<<WEB-INF/portlet.xml>>>).   Pluto 2.0 uses JAXB for marshalling and unmarshalling the object models.

    If you use the Pluto descriptor services in your own project, be
sure to code to the interface <<<org.apache.pluto.descriptors.services.PortletAppDescriptorService>>>
and not directly to the implementation classes.

* XML parsing in Pluto 2.x

    In Pluto 2.x, JAXB is used to (un)marshal the descriptor files.  Pluto 2.x
requires JDK 1.5 and will use JAXP for XML parsing.  No XML parsers
are required to be endorsed.

* XML parsing in Pluto 1.1.x

    In Pluto 1.1.x, Castor is used to (un)marshal the descriptor files.  Pluto
1.1.x targets JDK 1.4, therefore 1.1.x distributions will include endorsed
XML libraries in Tomcat 5's <<<common/endorsed>>> directory.

  However, if your runtime is JDK 1.5 or greater and you are running
Pluto 1.1.5+, Pluto will automatically configure Castor to use JAXP.
If you meet these criteria (JDK 1.5+, Pluto 1.1.5+), no XML libraries need 
to be endorsed - simply delete them from Tomcat 5's common/endorsed directory.
When Castor is configured to use JAXP, the parser that was defined by the 
Castor property <<<org.exolab.castor.parser>>> is ignored.

    If for some reason you need to override the the use of JAXP, set the system
property <<<org.apache.pluto.useJaxp>>> to the string <<<false>>>.  When the 
property is set to <<<false>>>, Castor will use the parser defined by the 
<<<org.exolab.castor.parser>>> property.  You will be responsible for providing 
the XML parser APIs and implementation libraries.
