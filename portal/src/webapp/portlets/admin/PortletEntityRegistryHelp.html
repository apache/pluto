<h2>Portlet Entity Registry Portlet Help</h2>
<p class="portlet-font">
This portlet is a view of data contained in the portletentityregistry.xml
file located in <CATALINA_HOME>/webapps/pluto/WEB-INF/data. This file is
 used to define Pluto's portlet applications.
</p>

<h3>View Mode</h3>
<p class="portlet-font">
Each row represents a portlet application in Pluto.
In portletentityregistry.xml this is manifested in an application element.
The application id column represents the id attribute of the application element,
while the Definition ID column contains the application name and portlet name
separated by a period. The application name is the same name as the war file
and webapps subdirectory where the portlet application is deployed. The
portlet name comes from the portlet-name element in the portlet app's portlet.xml
file.
