  <subsection name="Where We're Headed">
  <p>
    Having recently graduated from the incubator, the first
    goal of our community is the release a binary version of
    the Pluto Container.  This binary release will be based
    upon the initial Pluto contribution which was donated by
    IBM.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several people have suggested a revolutionary approach to
    Pluto's implementation.  The suggestion centers around the
    complexity of the current implementation and a desire to
    make Pluto more "container like". 
    Pluto 1.1, a second generation implementation, is an attempt
    to do just that.
    See the <a href="1.1/index.html">Pluto 1.1 section</a> of
    the online documentation for more details.
