/**
 * Provides callback for executing portal administration
 * tasks within the portlet environment.  This is key for
 * when the portal needs to accessing items such as the
 * session.
 *
 * Example Use Cases for the PortalAdministrationService:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>PortletException
 *   <p>The portal wants to ensure that portlets never
 *      become stuck in an unusable state.  To make sure
 *      this happens, they want the ability to clear the
 *      session if they repetedly catch exception from
 *      container invocations
 *   </p>
 *   <p>By implementing this services and registering
 *      and administrative request handler, the portal
 *      can invoke the doAdmin method of the container
 *      and then receive the request through the handler
 *      executing within the portlet environment (as
 *      opposed to the portal environment)
 *   </p>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
