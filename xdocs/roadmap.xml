  <subsection name="Where We're Headed">
  <p>
    Having recently graduated from the incubator, the first
    goal of our community is the release a binary version of
    the Pluto Container.  This binary release will be based
    upon the initial Pluto contribution which was donated by
    IBM.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several people have suggested a revolutionary approach to
    Pluto's implementation.  The suggestion centers around the
    complexity of the current implementation and a desire to
    make Pluto more "container like".  In the future, a 
    second generation of pluto may be implemented to simplify
    Pluto's implemetation and to use more standard design
    patterns.  IoC has been mentioned as a possible container
    design.
