PLUTO 1.1
==========================

Pluto is licensed under the Apache 2 License and contains
other opens source libraries.  Each dependency license is
included within this distribution.

INSTALLATION:
-------------------------
Installation of Pluto 1.1 can be completed by completing
the following steps:

1) Set the property name 'pluto.testsuite.dir' to
   the directory in which the pluto testsuite source
   code exists.  The testsuite is not currently included
   the 1.1 branch as no changes are necessary. (NOTE, 
   the web.xml does contain minor changes and thus
   it must be deployed using the 1.1 deployer. The deployment
   targets will handle updating the webapp appropriately).

2) Set the property named 'tomcat.dir' to the
   directory which is your TOMCAT_HOME (or TOMCAT_BASE)
   directory.  This directory will be used when determining
   where to deploy the portal. (The property 
   'maven.tomcat.dir' is now deprecated, but it does 
   still work).

4) Run the 'pluto:deploy-all' maven goal. This will install
   the Container (and all dependencies), the Portal Driver
   (and all dependencies), and the Testsuite.

5) Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/pluto/portal

6) That's IT!

PORTLET DEPLOYMENT:
-------------------------
Portlet Deployment is still underway, however, significant
progress has been made in allowing for automated deployment
of compliant portlet applications.  To date, the easiest way
to deploy a custom portlet application is to use maven.  The
pluto deployer contains maven plugins which allow for it to
be executed just like the maven war goal.  The plugin is 
automatically installed whenever the deploy-all goal is
run from the source distribution.  To install the plugin
manually, do the following:

1) From <PLUTO_HOME>, cd deploy

2) Execute the maven "plugin:install" goal

3) That's IT!

Once installed, you may assemble portlets in any maven
project by using the 'pluto:assemble' goal, and deploy
portlets in any maven project by using the 'pluto:deploy'
goal (The deploy goal will ensure that your portlets are
assembled properly - there's no need to do both).

The plugin supports the following properties:

maven.pluto.deployer
  description: class of the Deployer which should be used
  default:     org.apache.pluto.deploy.impl.Tomcat5FileSystemDeployer

  dependent properties:
    tomcat.home (or maven.tomcat.home)
      description:  location of tomcat
      default: 

    tomcat.host (or maven.tomcat.host)
      description: the name of the tomcat host to deploy to
      default:     localhost

    tomcat.service (or maven.tomcat.service)
      description: the name of the tomcat service to deploy to
      default:     Catalina
