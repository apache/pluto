/**
 * The <CODE>ResourceResponse</CODE> defines an object to assist a portlet 
 * for rendering a resource.
 * <p>
 * The difference between the <CODE>RenderResponse</CODE> is that for the 
 * <CODE>ResourceResponse</CODE> the output of this response is delivered
 * directly to the client without any additional markup added by the portal.
 * It is therefore allowed for the portlet to return binary content in this
 * response.
 * <p>
 * A portlet can set HTTP headers for the response via the setProperty or 
 * addProperty call in the <CODE>ResourceResponse</CODE>. 
 * To be successfully transmitted back to the client, headers must be set 
 * before the response is committed. Headers set after the response is 
 * committed will be ignored by the portlet container.
 * <p>
 * The portlet container creates a <CODE>ResourceResponse</CODE> object and 
 * passes it as argument to the portlet's <CODE>serveResource</CODE> method.
 * 
 * @see ResourceServingPortlet
 * @see MimeResponse
