        Pluto is the Reference Implementation of the Java Portlet Specfication.
        The current version (2.0) of this specification is JSR-286. JSR-168 covers
        version 1.0 of the specification. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Portlets are designed to run in the context of a portal. They are
        written to the Portlet API which are similar to the Servlet API.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to servlets, portlets may not do things like sending
        redirects or errors to browsers directly, forwarding requests or writing
        arbitrary markup to the output stream to assure that they don't distract
        the portal web application which uses them. Another difference compared
        to servlets is that portlets rely on portal specific infrastructure
        functions such as access to user profile information, standard interface
        for storing/retrieving persistent settings, getting client information,
        etc. Generally, portlets are administrated more dynamically than
        servlets.
      </p>
      <p>
        A portlet container provides a runtime environment for portlets
        implemented according to the Portlet API. In this environment portlets
        can be instantiated, used and finally destroyed. The portlet container
        is not a stand-alone container like the servlet container; instead it is
        implemented as a thin layer on top of the servlet container and reuses
        the functionality provided by the servlet container.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pluto serves as portlet container that implements the Portlet API and
        offers developers a working example platform from which they can test
        their portlets. However, it's cumbersome to execute and test the portlet
        container without a driver, in this case, the portal. Pluto's simple
        portal component is built only on the portlet container's and the JSR
        168's requirements. (In contrast, the more sophisticated, Jetspeed
        project concentrates on the portal itself rather than the portlet
        container, and considers requirements from other groups.)

    <section name="Project Status">
      <p>
        Apache Pluto is a subproject of the Apache Portals Project. The current
        stable release of Apache Pluto is version 1.1.6, a JSR-168 implementation.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Pluto 2.0">
        <p>
           Pluto 2.0, built from the Pluto 1.1 code-base, is the reference implementation
           of version 2.0 of the Java Portlet API specification (JSR-286). The JSR-286
           specification adds interportlet coordination (events and shared render parameters), 
           portlet filters and resource serving to the Portlet API in addition to 
           numerous other changes from version 1.0.
        </p>
     </subsection>
        
      <subsection name="Pluto 1.1">
        <p>
          Pluto 1.1 introduces a new container architecture. If you are
          embedding Pluto in your portal, realize that 1.1 is not binarily
          compatible with Pluto 1.0.x.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pluto 1.1 aims to simplify the architecture in order to make it more
          user and developer friendly. You should find Pluto 1.1 easier to get
          started with, easier to understand, and easier to embed with your
          portal. Your feedback regarding how far we've come is always welcome
          on the user and developer mailing lists!
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Pluto 1.0.1">
        <p>
          Pluto 1.0.1 is the first stable release of Pluto. This version of
          Pluto is utilized as the portlet container for Jetspeed and other
          portals. In addition, Pluto 1.0.1 is embeded within Apache Geronimo.
